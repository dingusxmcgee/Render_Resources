# Render Resources

Some of my keyboard projects that I have open sourced(or will be releasing soon) for the community.
OBJs for various boards are available in their respective folder and in most cases contain a top and bottom along with a plate, all in the same file.


Zoinks - Uniform stagger 9 key macropad
XLant - 14u version of a Zlant
Emma - Prime_E/Alice style board with a fixed, ortho-esque layout
Alpha9 - Southpaw version of the alpha9(alpha 28 key with a 9key numpad)
JerKey - Prime_E/Alice style 30% with wristrest - Created to fit the Jerkin PCB by Worldspawn.
